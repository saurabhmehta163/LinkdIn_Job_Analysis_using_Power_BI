I developed a comprehensive LinkedIn Job Analysis project using Power BI, aimed at providing insights into job market trends, geographical distribution, and various hiring patterns. The project consists of 5 interactive dashboards/pages that offer a deep dive into different aspects of the job market. The key features include:

**Market Trends:** Analyzed job market trends over time, highlighting the growth or decline in specific industries and roles.

**Geographical Analysis:** Explored job opportunities across different regions, identifying high-demand locations and the distribution of job postings.

**Job Contract Analysis:** Investigated the distribution of job types (e.g., full-time, part-time, contract), providing insights into employer preferences and workforce trends.

**Application Type:** Visualized data on the types of applications received for different job positions, helping to understand candidate behavior and employer expectations.

**Predictive Modeling:** Applied machine learning techniques to predict future job market trends based on historical data, offering valuable forecasting insights.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in data visualization, predictive analytics, and Power BI reporting, showcasing my ability to extract actionable insights from complex datasets.
